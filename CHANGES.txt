v0.0.1, 29-Oct-2020 -- initial setup
 (Initial development captured in git log)

31-Oct-2020 -- implement Linear; implement tests
 1-Nov-2020 -- implement Scale; migrate pre/post parsing to a sub-function
 2-Nov-2020 --
            - implement Wrap;
            - fix docs;
            - make Identity idempotent
            - add PlusOne_ (non-idempotent test transform)
            - add ArrayIndex (idempotent Transform)
            - fix Composition to accept a list of Transforms
            - fix Composition to serialize compositions of compositions
            - tests for everyone!!
- 12-Nov-2020 (CED) --
            - Add helpers.py and tests
              - apply_boundary: implements boundary conditions
              - sampleND: implements PDL range() using python "advanced indexing"
              - interpND: implements general-purpose ND interpolation
                - Currently implemented:  sample, linear, cubic, Fourier, many filters
 
30-Jun-2021 -- objects are more or less complete;  nearing release  
 	- Full functionality is present for transform manipulation
 	- Vector transformation works 
 	- Resampling with non-anti-aliasing works
 	- Anti-aliasing code is implemented and has rudimentary testing in place
 	- DataWrapper object carts around metadata; needs to be adapted to work with NDCube and/or sunpy maps
	- Migrate to Cython for helpers.pyx
	- Jacobian manipulation functions in helpers.pyx
	- implement interpND_grid for resampling engine
	- implement interpND_jacobian for anti-aliased reampling engine
		- only works for 2-D transformations for now
