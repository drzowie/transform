Methods to fix
--------------
* Check DataWrapper methods and header export
  - CTYPE and CUNIT not being exported from wcs objects in wcs2head method (track in header manually?)

Transforms to fix
-----------------
* Polar & tests
   - Check degrees implementation: not working quite right yet? (inverse/forward not in agreement?)

Functionality to add
--------------------
* Propagate units through apply (think about this)
* Vet and update FITS handling
  - Solve weirdnesses with WCS overlay
  - Add SunPy objects
  - handle FITS objects better
  - handle tuples
* Add anti-aliasing to interpND (will require Cython)

Transforms to implement
-----------------------
* Projective
* Pincushion
* Lookup
* Code shortcut for easier hackitude later?
